# mathWithx86Architecture
The Program computes infinite series using NASM Assembly and demonstrates the intricacies of low level language and the x86 architecture. The program uses various CPU registers, push/pops, jumps, and stack management to perform the calculations. Run the makefile in command line. Do note that NASM and a C compiler like GCC has to be installed. The NASM manual can be downloaded at http://www.nasm.us/doc/ and information about the GCC compiler can be found at https://gcc.gnu.org/
